Hi there this is my repository where I try out stuff for data science 
list of contents:
  ([MNIST Number Recognition/NN with Numpy.ipynb](https://github.com/AryaVatsa/DS-Tryouts-personal/blob/main/MNIST%20Number%20Recognition/NN%20with%20Numpy.ipynb))
    -recognition of MNIST handwwritten dataset with my own dense neural net model using numpy 
    
  ([Human Keyboard Spam Recognition/Keyboard Spam Bayes.ipynb](https://github.com/AryaVatsa/DS-Tryouts-personal/blob/main/Human%20Keyboard%20Spam%20Recognition/Keyboard%20Spam%20Bayes.ipynb))
    -classify human keyboard spam and pseud random numbers generated by python's random library 
    -tried using dense neural net with same  architecture as MNIST recogniser (did not work)
    -tried naive bayes algorithm (68% accuracy)
    -will try gaussian bayes next 

more information available in code comments in respective source code files
