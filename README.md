Hi there this is my repository where I try out data science and AI projects 



list of contents:


  ([MNIST Number Recognition/NN with Numpy.ipynb](https://github.com/AryaVatsa/DS-Tryouts-personal/blob/main/MNIST%20Number%20Recognition/NN%20with%20Numpy.ipynb))
   
  &emsp;&emsp;-recognition of MNIST handwritten dataset with my own dense neural net model using numpy (>90% accuracy)

  &emsp;-uses simple gradient descent as optimiser (easiest for me to implement)

  &nbsp;-will try using deep learning with keras to upscale to image recognition (likely classify cats and dogs)

  



    
  ([Human Keyboard Spam Recognition/Keyboard Spam Bayes.ipynb](https://github.com/AryaVatsa/DS-Tryouts-personal/blob/main/Human%20Keyboard%20Spam%20Recognition/Keyboard%20Spam%20Bayes.ipynb))
    
  -classify human keyboard spam and pseud random numbers generated by python's random library 
  
  -tried using dense neural net with same  architecture as MNIST recogniser (did not work)
  
  -tried naive bayes algorithm (68% accuracy)
  
  -will try gaussian bayes next
