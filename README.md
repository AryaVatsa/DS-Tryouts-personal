Hi there this is my repository where I try out data science and AI projects 



list of contents:


  &emsp;[MNIST Number Recognition/NN with Numpy.ipynb](https://github.com/AryaVatsa/DS-Tryouts-personal/blob/main/MNIST%20Number%20Recognition/NN%20with%20Numpy.ipynb)
   
  &emsp;&emsp;-recognition of MNIST handwritten dataset with my own dense neural net model using numpy (>90% accuracy)

  &emsp;&emsp;-uses simple gradient descent as optimiser (easiest for me to implement)

  &emsp;&emsp;-will try using deep learning with keras to upscale to image recognition (likely classify cats and dogs)

  



    
  &emsp;[Human Keyboard Spam Recognition/Keyboard Spam Bayes.ipynb](https://github.com/AryaVatsa/DS-Tryouts-personal/blob/main/Human%20Keyboard%20Spam%20Recognition/Keyboard%20Spam%20Bayes.ipynb)
    
  &emsp;&emsp;-classify human keyboard spam and pseudo random numbers generated by python's random library 
  
  &emsp;&emsp;-tried using dense neural net with same  architecture as MNIST recogniser (did not work)
  
  &emsp;&emsp;-tried naive bayes algorithm (68% accuracy)
  
  &emsp;&emsp;-will try gaussian bayes next
